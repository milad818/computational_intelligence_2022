## Task

Write agents able to play [*Nim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim), with an arbitrary number of rows and an upper bound $k$ on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn (a.k.a., *subtraction game*).

The player **taking the last object wins**.

* Task3.1: An agent using fixed rules based on *nim-sum* (i.e., an *expert system*)

* Task3.3: An agent using minmax
* Task3.4: An agent using reinforcement learning
